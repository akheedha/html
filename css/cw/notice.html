      <p><h1> Comprehensive Update on Wellness & Technology PolicyDate:</h1>
        <p> October 25, 2025</p>
        <p>To: All Students, Parents/Guardians, Faculty, and StaffFrom: Principal Anya SharmaIntroduction: Embracing a Balanced FutureDear School Community,This notice serves as a comprehensive communication regarding a significant, dual-faceted initiative: the enhancement of our School Wellness Program and a crucial update to our Technology and Device Usage Policy. In our commitment to fostering a holistic and supportive learning environment, these changes are designed to promote better physical and mental health while ensuring technology is a constructive tool, not a distraction, in our educational process. We recognize that effective policy changes require clear communication, understanding, and community-wide collaboration, which is why this detailed notice is being issued.ðŸ§˜ Wellness Program Expansion: "Mind, Body, & Balance"Our expanded Wellness Program, "Mind, Body, & Balance," is centered on integrating physical activity, mental health support, and nutritional education into the daily school routine. This initiative moves beyond traditional health classes to create a culture of well-being.Mental Health & Support ServicesWe are significantly enhancing our on-campus counseling resources. Starting November 1st, we will be introducing:"Mindful Minutes": Ten-minute guided breathing and stretching exercises integrated into all classes just before lunch and at the start of the final period. [(Approx. 80 words of detail could be added here on the implementation and purpose of Mindful Minutes)]Expanded Counseling Hours: The Student Services office will now offer walk-in mental health support from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM daily, ensuring immediate access to a licensed counselor or social worker. Furthermore, we are piloting a peer-to-peer support network, the 'Lighthouse Program', where trained older students can offer non-professional, confidential listening services during lunch breaks. [(Approx. 120 words of detail could be added here on the training of peer supporters and confidentiality guidelines)]Parent Workshops: Three evening workshops per semester will focus on recognizing signs of stress, anxiety, and depression in adolescents, providing tools for home support.Physical Education & ActivityTo combat sedentary screen time, we are revising the Physical Education (PE) curriculum and encouraging daily movement:Mandatory 'Active Hour': For all grade levels, the last Friday of every month will replace the final two periods with an 'Active Hour', offering choices from hiking, team sports, yoga, or community service with physical components (e.g., schoolyard cleanup).New Fitness Center Rules: The school fitness center has been renovated and is now available to students, supervised by PE staff, every Tuesday and Thursday after school until 5:00 PM. A signed parental waiver is mandatory for student use. [(Approx. 75 words of detail could be added here about the specific equipment and safety rules)]ðŸ“± Technology and Device Usage Policy UpdateThe goal of the updated Technology Policy is to maximize the educational benefits of personal and school devices while minimizing digital distractions and promoting digital citizenship. These changes apply to all personal devices (smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, etc.) brought onto school grounds.'Smart Start, Clear Focus' Device ProtocolThis new protocol is effective immediately and simplifies our approach to device use:School AreaDesignated TimePolicy/RegulationClassroomsAll Instructional Time'Tech-Only-as-Directed': Devices must be stored out of sight and on silent unless explicitly incorporated into the lesson by the teacher for an instructional purpose (e.g., research, educational apps). Non-compliance will result in immediate confiscation and disciplinary action.Lunch & Recess12:00 PM - 1:00 PM'Unplugged Zone': This is a dedicated time for social interaction, movement, and eating. Personal devices must remain stored in lockers or bags. [(Approx. 90 words of rationale could be added here on social-emotional learning benefits)]Transition TimeHallway/Locker UseDevices may be briefly used to check essential communication, but not for games, social media, or phone calls.Policy Rationale and Digital CitizenshipThe restriction during non-instructional time is based on extensive research linking device presence to reduced focus, increased social anxiety, and cyber-bullying incidents. We are committed to teaching responsible digital citizenship. This includes:No Photography/Video Policy: Unless explicitly permitted by a teacher or administrator, taking photos or videos of students or staff is strictly prohibited to protect privacy and prevent misuse.Consequences for Misuse: Violations will follow a three-tier system: (1) Device held by the teacher for the remainder of the day, (2) Device held by administration, and a mandatory parent meeting, (3) Progressive disciplinary action, including potential suspension. [(Approx. 150 words of detail could be added here on the specific three-tier system and digital literacy education)]ðŸ“ž Next Steps and ResourcesWe understand these are significant changes, and we believe they are essential for creating the best possible environment for academic success and personal well-being.Full Policy Document: A complete, detailed version of the 'School-Wide Wellness and Technology Policy' is available on the school's website under the 'Policies' section.Q&A Session: Principal Sharma and the Vice-Principal will host a virtual Parent Q&A Session via Zoom on November 7th at 6:30 PM. A link will be sent out next week.Student Orientation: All homeroom teachers will lead a mandatory review of these changes with students during the week of October 28th.We thank you for your commitment to our school community and your support in implementing these important standards. Together, we can foster a balanced, healthy, and focused environment for every student.Sincerely,Anya SharmaPrincipalSchool
