            <p> <span> <strong> The Great Gatsby </strong></spans> <span><em>by F. Scott Fitzgerald </em>  </span> <span> It tells the story of Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire, and his pursuit of Daisy Buchanan, a wealthy young woman whom  he loved in his youth. Set in 1920s New York, the book is narrated by Nick Carraway. After moving to the fictionalWest Egg on Long Island, Nick comes to know Gatsby, who asks for his help in reconnecting with Daisy, now married to Tom Buchanan.

            <p> <span> <strong> To Kill a Mockingbird </strong></spans> <span><em>by Harper Lee </em>  </span> <span>o Kill a Mockingbird, novel by American author Harper Lee, published in 1960. Enormously popular, it was translated into some 40 languages, sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, and is one of the most-assigned novels in American schools. In 1961 it won a Pulitzer Prize. The novel was praised for its sensitive treatment of a child’s awakening to racism and prejudice in the American South. The story is told by Scout Finch, who lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. The events of the novel unfold during three years of the Great Depression in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama. Scout and Jem befriend </span> </p>
            <p> <span> <strong> 1984 </strong></spans> <span><em>by George Orwell </em>  </span> <span>1984, novel by George Orwell published in 1949 as a warning against totalitarianism. The chilling dystopia made a deep impression on readers, and his ideas entered mainstream culture in a way achieved by very few books. The term Orwellian—describing a totalitarian state characterized by government surveillance and control of thought—has become part of the English language. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, is a province of the superstate Oceania. The Party, led by Big Brother, employs advanced technology to persecute individualism and independent thinking as "thoughtcrimes." The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful worker and a member of the Outer Party who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He begins a forbidden love affair with Julia, a like-minded woman, and they both rent a room above a shop as their private sanctuary. However, their rebellion is short-lived as they are betrayed, arrested by the Thought Police, and subjected to brutal torture and re-education. The novel ends with Winston's complete acceptance of the Party's ideology and his love for Big Brother. 1984 is a profound anti-utopian novel that examines the dangers of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviors within society.</span>  </p>
